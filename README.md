# Feed the PacArMan
My projects

Here are some of my projects that I have worked on!

"Feed the PacArMan" augmented reality game for Android users.
You will find all the scripts at directory "Scripts", where there is all the code that we need to develop a user-friendly game like this.
That's a game based on augmented reality technology and we use "Unity engine" in order to create the game.
The main idea of this game is to make the user move around the physical enviroment and collect objects at the virtual enviroment. There is action during the game, because he must avoid the moving enemies who are chasing the user.
It is free for use and available at Google Play Store.
