My projects

Here are some of my projects that I have worked on!

"Feed the PacArMan" augmented reality game for Android users.
In the folder scripts there is all the code that we need to develope the "Feed the PacArMan" from the beginning to a user friendly game.
That's a game based on augmented reality technology. We use "Unity engine" in order to create the game.
The main idea of this game is that the user must move around the physical enviroment and collect objects at the virtual enviroment. Also, there is action during the game, because he must avoid the moving enemies, who chasing the user. 
It is free for use and available at Google Play Store.
